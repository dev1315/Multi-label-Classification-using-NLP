# Multi-label Toxic Comment Classification
**This is a problem of multi-label classification many times people confuse in multi-label and multi-class.**
* The main difference between the two is lying in the concept of being mutually exclusive
* **Multi-class classifications** problems are those where each sample belongs to atmost one class only. Eg: In a coin toss the result can either be a heads or tails
* Whereas in case of **Multi-label classifications** each sample may belong to more than one class. Eg: A news article may belong to sports as well as politics.
