# Multi-label Toxic Comment Classification
**This is a problem of multi-label classification many times people confuse in multi-label and multi-class.**
* The main difference between the two is lying in the concept of being mutually exclusive
* **Multi-class classifications** problems are those where each sample belongs to atmost one class only. Eg: In a coin toss the result can either be a heads or tails
* Whereas in case of **Multi-label classifications** each sample may belong to more than one class. Eg: A news article may belong to sports as well as politics.

* This project includes feature engineering like finding pattern for assesing the labels like Word count, Specific symbols, no of unique words used.
* It also includes text cleaning like removing \n ,expanding contractions, punctuations, numbers, extra whitespaces and stop words.
* I have used different types of multilabel classifiers and compared their over all performance.

* **For this project i have tried using different libraries**
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Textstat
* NLTK
* Spacy
* Re
* Spellchecker
* WordCloud
* Scikit-Learn
* Scikit-multiLearn
